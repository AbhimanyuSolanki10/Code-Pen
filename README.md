Online Code Editor - Code Pen Project

This project is an online code editor, marking my first venture into web development. The editor allows users to write and execute HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code directly in the browser. It is designed to provide a simple, yet powerful, environment for experimenting with web technologies.

Key Features:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Editors: Separate editors for writing and previewing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, with syntax highlighting provided by CodeMirror.
Live Preview: A built-in iframe that dynamically updates to show the results of your code.
Run and Clear Buttons: Easily run your code or clear the editor with a single click, enhancing the user experience.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for various screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
Technologies Used:
HTML & CSS: Structure and styling of the editor interface.
JavaScript: Handles the core functionality, including loading and running the user's code in real-time.
CodeMirror: Provides an enhanced coding experience with features like syntax highlighting, line numbers, and bracket matching.
How It Works:
Editors: The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript editors are powered by CodeMirror, configured with a dark "monokai" theme and active line highlighting.
Run Code: When the "RUN" button is clicked, the editor content is injected into an iframe to display the result.
Clear Code: The "CLEAR" button resets all editor content, providing a fresh start.
This project demonstrates how various web technologies can be integrated to create a functional, user-friendly online code editor. It serves as a practical tool for anyone looking to test small code snippets or learn web development.
